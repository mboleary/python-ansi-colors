# Python Ansi Colors
###### Brady O'Leary 2019

This is a wrapper for printing colors to a terminal emulator, providing user-friendly APIs to generate colored text strings with the use of a class.

## System Requirements

Python 3.5 or greater

Must be using a Terminal with the ability to display colors.

## Implementation

This module uses a class to make a section of colored text.

## Use

To use this class, import the `Text` class from `ansicolors.py`

## Testing

To test functionality, run the module as a Python program. It should print some colored text and exit.

Be advised that this testing function generates every possible RGB Color (0-255 for R, G, and B), so it will take awhile, and the output in a file is around half a gigabyte.
